# groupSHAP-uncertainty
This tutorial in the form of a [R markdown](tutorial_synthetic.Rmd) shows an example of how to apply the group-based SHAP approach to decompose the prediction uncertainty.
The data (file: *bioclim.tif*) are based on the vignette of the R package [CAST](https://hannameyer.github.io/CAST/articles/cast02-AOA-tutorial.html).
